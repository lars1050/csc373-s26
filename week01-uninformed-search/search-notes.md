purpose of explore
best and worst nodes explored
assessment on what is better (or under what circumstance)
max nodes on frontier
why not check goal before going on frontier?
something about multiple answers but only 1 optimal
something about bidirectional search
can you make a (simple) graph in which dijkstra explores all paths before finding optimal?

what were the timing differences (or node count differences) in situation X? why?
represent the problem X for this.
